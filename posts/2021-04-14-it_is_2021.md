(I am still working on this...)

It is 2021, my website is outdated, let's refresh it !

I want my website to be fast, light, with images, hosted on a CDN...

# Structure

I though about Jekyll, but we are in 2021 and [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) looks more simple and I can have [pug](https://pugjs.org) as a
template engine


# Style

I though about bootstrap, but we are in 2021 so I should try [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) with [PostCSS](https://www.postcss.parts/)

# Blog

I will try to blog and a blog should be a file like this:

```
This should be dynamically included !
```


# Images

This is what I used:

- [11ty Image Plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/) for the image
- [Sqip](https://github.com/axe312ger/sqip) for the placeholder
- [This link](https://www.andreaverlicchi.eu/lazy-load-responsive-images-in-2020-srcset-sizes-picture-webp/) for inspiration

# Fonts
